# Ultravox

I've recently made a knowledge sharing session about Ultravox, a Speech Language Model (SLM) that processes speech directly, without conversion to text, which allows for a much better conversational experience. The video was recorded and I published it on Youtube (see below) with all of the participant's video and audio removed.

By watching the video, you’ll understand

- What is a speech model and why using it can offer benefits over the cascaded ASR + LLM + TTS pipeline
- Why Ultravox can be a good solution compared to other providers (such as OpenAI’s realtime API)
- How to use Ultravox
