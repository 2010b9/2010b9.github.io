# TNC 22

## What is TNC?

TNC is the largest and most prestigious research and education networking conference, attractting a diverse audience of over 800 participants from more than 70 countries and offers a unique collaborative experience.

## Why was I there?

I participated in a [FCCN](https://www.fccn.pt/en/) programme, which provided me with the opportunity to do a *Lightning Talk* at TNC 22, which is a 5min presentation about a particular topic. In my case, it was about my Master's thesis, *Fake News Detection Models — Introducing GAN Generated Synthetic Samples to Improve Performance*. In a nutshell, news datasets are extremely imbalanced, with the fake news not being as well represented as the real news. Thus, machine learning models for fake news detection do not perform as good as expected. Hence, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to produce high-quality synthetic samples to better represent the fake news data, improving the models’ performances.
