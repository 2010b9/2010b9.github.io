              This paper focuses on the creation and evaluation of synthetic
              data to address the challenges of imbalanced datasets in machine
              learning applications (ML), using fake news detection as a case
              study. We conducted a thorough literature review on generative
              adversarial networks (GANs) for tabular data, synthetic data
              generation methods, and synthetic data quality assessment. By
              augmenting a public news dataset with synthetic data generated by
              different GAN architectures, we demonstrate the potential of
              synthetic data to improve ML models' performance in fake news
              detection. Our results show a significant improvement in
              classification performance, especially in the underrepresented
              class. We also modify and extend a data usage approach to evaluate
              the quality of synthetic data and investigate the relationship
              between synthetic data quality and data augmentation performance
              in classification tasks. We found a positive correlation between
              synthetic data quality and performance in the underrepresented
              class, highlighting the importance of high-quality synthetic data
              for effective data augmentation.

              Synthetic data consists of artificially generated data. When data
              are scarce, or of poor quality, synthetic data can be used, for
              example, to improve the performance of machine learning models.
              Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a state-of-the-art deep
              generative models that can generate novel synthetic samples that
              follow the underlying data distribution of the original dataset.
              Reviews on synthetic data generation and on GANs have already been
              written. However, none in the relevant literature, to the best of
              our knowledge, has explicitly combined these two topics. This
              survey aims to fill this gap and provide useful material to new
              researchers in this field. That is, we aim to provide a survey
              that combines synthetic data generation and GANs, and that can act
              as a good and strong starting point for new researchers in the
              field, so that they have a general overview of the key
              contributions and useful references. We have conducted a review of
              the state-of-the-art by querying four major databases: Web of
              Sciences (WoS), Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. This
              allowed us to gain insights into the most relevant authors, the
              most relevant scientific journals in the area, the most cited
              papers, the most significant research areas, the most important
              institutions, and the most relevant GAN architectures. GANs were
              thoroughly reviewed, as well as their most common training
              problems, their most important breakthroughs, and a focus on GAN
              architectures for tabular data. Further, the main algorithms for
              generating synthetic data, their applications and our thoughts on
              these methods are also expressed. Finally, we reviewed the main
              techniques for evaluating the quality of synthetic data
              (especially tabular data) and provided a schematic overview of the
              information presented in this paper.

              On Creation of Synthetic Samples from GANs for Fake News

              The use of Generative Adversarial Networks is almost traditional
              in creating synthetic images for medical purposes. They are
              probably the best use of GANs until now, as their results can
              easily be checked by the eye of specialists. In fake news
              detection models, we have seen lately that neural models (and deep
              learning) can provide a considerable improvement from standard
              classifiers. Yet, the most problematic problem still is the lack
              of data, mostly fake news data to feed these models. In this
              paper, we address that by proposing the use of a GAN. Results show
              a better capacity to generalize when used for training an extended
              dataset based on synthetic samples created by this GAN.

              It is common for people to choose their next movie or show through
              other viewers' experience statements, like the Internet Movie
              Database (IMDb) presents. In this paper, we will be inspecting the
              IMDb public datasets, processing them, and using a visual
              analytics approach to understand how a movie can be successful
              among its fans. The main exploration focus is regions where titles
              are translated to, how the success of a title relates to its cast,
              crew, and awards nominations/wins. We took a methodology based on
              hypothesis formulation based on the EDA exploration and their
              testing based on a visual analytics confirmation.
